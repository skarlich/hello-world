MI 349

I am a senior at MSU, I am a photographer full time, and plan on doing content creation or media managenent for a company after I graduate. I like outdoor and high energy sports. I studied engineering for 3 years before deciding to switch to MI when I took an MI course. I still love physics and building things!
